        So if you couldn't tell already, I'm not great at frontend design. My goal with this website was not to show off my webdev skills. <br /> <br />

        You may be asking <strong className="text-warning-emphasis">"why not just use a website generator in that case?"</strong> <br /> <br />

        That's a good question. Honestly, the idea of putting minimal effort into building a cool looking website was tempting, but it just sounded lame to me.
