      <h2>About this site</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        This website was made with React, Typescript, Vite, and Bootstrap.

        So if you couldn't tell already, I'm not great at frontend design. My goal with this website was <strong>not</strong> to show off my webdev skills. <br /> <br />

        You may be asking <strong className="text-danger-emphasis">"why not just use a website generator in that case?"</strong> <br /> <br />

        That's a great question. Honestly, I think I just liked the idea of a casual challenge for myself. I've been learning how to use React and Typescript for a different project and figured I'd use
        my new knowledge on something for myself. Plus, I prefer not to use LLMs or generators when I'm trying to learn a new skill. I'll use LLMs to help explain concepts, but when writing code, I learn
        best when I'm forced to type and really think about what goes into my codebase.
